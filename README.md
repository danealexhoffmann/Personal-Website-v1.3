# [My Personal Website](https://danealexhoffmann.netlify.app/)

The first iteration of my portfolio website, Built with React and Pure CSS. My goal was to put together a simple, visually pleasing website that showcases some of the development projects I have worked on while also telling the user a bit about myself and my personality. 

## What I learnt while building this project.

I built this project after finishing my initial React course. I learnt to use React Router which allowed me to setup a single-page-application which still allowed for the display of multiple "pages" which hold different information across the site. 

Using pure CSS to style this project I learnt more about how to arrange and lay out elements using CSS grids while using a Figma file for design reference. The biggest challenge was being able to effectively arrange each element on the website properly so that visually the site was not presented in a "messy' state.
